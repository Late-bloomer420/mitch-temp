Privacy-First Personal Data Infrastructure
CORE PRINCIPLES (DO NOT BREAK)
• Data stays with the user
• Access replaces ownership
• AI is a local gatekeeper, not a data owner
• Each layer knows only what it must
• Only proofs or results leave the device
• All access is purpose-, scope-, and time-limited
• Trust is enforced by architecture, not promises
