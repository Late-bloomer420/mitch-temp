# 60 — Legal & Jurisdiction Security Strategy

Stand: 2026-02-11

## Scope
Covers strategic risks from state backdoor pressure and cross-jurisdiction policy conflict.

## A) Backdoor request strategy (principle)
1. No hidden escrow keys.
2. No architecture changes that silently degrade user privacy/security guarantees.
3. Transparency-first handling of extraordinary legal requests (where legally permitted).

## B) Jurisdiction compatibility model
1. Define policy profiles by jurisdiction (EU-first baseline).
2. Deny incompatible requests rather than weakening safeguards.
3. Keep explicit compatibility matrix for pilot partners.

## C) Pre-pilot legal deliverables
1. External legal opinion (roles, lawful basis, crypto-shredding language).
2. Jurisdiction scope statement (where pilot is allowed/unsupported).
3. Public security statement aligned with actual technical capabilities.

## D) Engineering implications
- Add explicit deny reason for jurisdictional incompatibility in future policy version.
- Keep policy change governance auditable and approval-gated.
