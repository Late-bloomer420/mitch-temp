# What miTch is NOT

To understand **miTch**, it is equally important to understand what it is designed *not* to be. This distinction is critical for investors, regulators, and partners.

## ❌ NOT a Blockchain
miTch uses cryptographic primitives (Hashing, Signatures, ZKP) often associated with blockchain, but it **does not require a distributed ledger** for its core function.
- **Why?** Blockchains are often slow, expensive, and **architecturally misaligned** with privacy-preserving identity systems.
- **Instead:** We use ephemeral P2P channels and standard PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).

## ❌ NOT a Social Network / Data Broker
We do not sell, aggregate, or analyze user data.
- **Why?** Our business model is "Compliance as a Service" for businesses, not "Users as a Product".
- **Instead:** We are infrastructure. Like a secure pipe—we ensure the data gets from A to B securely, but we don't look inside.

## ❌ NOT "Anonymity at all costs"
miTch is designed for **Accountability with Privacy**.
- **Why?** Total anonymity enables crime.
- **Instead:** We enable **Authorized Disclosures**. A user can prove they are authorized (e.g., "Over 18", "Licensed Doctor") without revealing their entire life history.

## ❌ NOT a "Government Replacement"
We do not issue base identities (passports, driver's licenses).
- **Why?** That is the role of the state.
- **Instead:** We are the **Wallet** that holds these digital credentials securely and helps you present them selectively. We work *with* eIDAS and other government frameworks, not against them.

## ❌ NOT a Speculative Crypto-Wallet
miTch does **not** hold cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or financial assets.

- **Why?** Mixing asset custody and speculation with identity infrastructure increases attack surface, regulatory burden (AML/MiCA), and user risk.
- **Identity requires a higher trust bar than money.**

## ✅ What miTch *can* be: A Personal Trust Hub
miTch is a **User-Controlled Authorization Agent**, acting as your digital key ring for the modern web.

It operates on two distinct layers:
1.  **Core Layer (The "Who"):** Uncompromising Identity & Policy Engine. No custody, no tracking.
2.  **Management Layer (The "What"):** Manages **proofs**, not raw assets.
    -   **Banking:** Proves "I am the account holder" for logging in, without being the bank app itself (PSD2 compliant).
    -   **Contracts:** Stores the cryptographic *proof* that a contract exists and is signed, not necessarily the PDF itself.
    -   **Invoices:** Proves "Invoice #123 is paid", without exposing your entire transaction history.

> **Crucial Difference:**
> *   **Apple Wallet** is a container with *Apple* as the Root of Trust.
> *   **miTch** is a User Agent with *You* as the Root of Trust.
>
> miTch does not store value. It stores **authority, consent, and proof**.

## 🎯 Target Audience
miTch is built for:
- **Regulated Industries:** Finance, Healthcare, E-Commerce (Age Verification).
- **Governments:** Public Services seeking secure, privacy-preserving digital ID rails.
- **Enterprises:** Organizations needing "Privacy-by-Design" compliance without infrastructure overhaul.
