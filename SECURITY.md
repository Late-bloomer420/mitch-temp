# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do **not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Report privately to the maintainers with:
- affected component
- reproduction steps
- potential impact
- suggested mitigation (if known)

We will acknowledge receipt and coordinate a fix + disclosure timeline.

## Scope
Security reports are prioritized for:
- policy enforcement bypasses
- fail-open behavior
- replay/binding weaknesses
- PII leakage in logs/receipts
